Asked Claude to recreate chat page from web app in mobile app, it asked whether I wanted a full feature by feature copy or just the basics, I said give it everything.  it then also asked if the app should also work in the background (which would require setting up push notifications) I said yes do that also (assuming it would run out of tokens)

It managed to complete these steps with about 66% of the session tokens, however it did not work.  The chat page did not even show the General chat which every user should see by default.  I then asked it to figure out why and it did some research and then said that it knew the cause, however before it could complete it ran out of tokens.
