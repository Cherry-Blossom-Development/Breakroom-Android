Today's prompt:

I have started you in a folder higher than I normally start because you may need to reference code from many of these folders.  first, everything in all the folders of this repo is my own code, but all you will really need to reference is the code in the Android folder (this is the app we are working on) and also the Breakroom folder (this is the web version of the app, which also includes the shared API which may need to change)

Today our first goal is to work on the Company Portal section, specifically the projects page.  You will model this after the web version.  I need to copy every basic functionality of the web version in mobile (the look and feel may have to change).  for this first task, lets get the projects to display, show a box with each project in it, the name, how many tickets, the view tickets and edit tickets buttons (not active yet), and the add project button (also not active yet).  Visually this should have everything the web version has, only in mobile.
