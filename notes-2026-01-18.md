Today's prompt:

I have started you in a folder higher than I normally start because you may need to reference code from many of these folders.  first, everything in all the folders of this repo is my own code, but all you will really need to reference is the code in the Android folder (this is the app we are working on) and also the Breakroom folder (this is the web version of the app, which also includes the shared API which may need to change)

Today our first goal is to work on the Company Portal section, specifically the projects page.  You will model this after the web version.  I need to copy every basic functionality of the web version in mobile (the look and feel may have to change).  for this first task, lets get the projects to display, show a box with each project in it, the name, how many tickets, the view tickets and edit tickets buttons (not active yet), and the add project button (also not active yet).  Visually this should have everything the web version has, only in mobile.

from our root folder you see Android which contains kotlin code to build an android app, and you see Breakroom
which is the front and back of web application in Vue and Express.js.  The backend of the web app also serves the
android app.  We are creating features in the android app to match the web version.  currently, both have a
company page (called Company Portal on web), from there you select My Companies and if you are user dallas you
will see one company, selecting it you get Info, Team, Recruit and Projects page.  on the projects page you see a
list of projects with View Tickets button for each, and edit button and a plus icon at the bottom to add a new
project.  none of these work at the moment.  Can you look at the web version of the Add Project button and copy
it's functionality into mobile?

Next can we also implement the edit project functionality?  it should be almost the same

Next, we need the view tickets functionality.  This is a bit different.  On web we have two ways to view tickets.  Since the Help Desk project is public it is made much simpler to thew view on web is also simpler.  For every other project we create a Kanban style board.  For mobile we also need to see the tickets but neither of those web structures will work because the view is too narrow.  We need to be able to see the tickets on mobile and my suggestion is to make something kind of like a kanban board for all projects but only show one swim-lane at a time, have some functionality to let the user go left and right between the lanes.

We are in a folder which includes many applicaitons but we are only concerned with the Android folder (this is where we are creating an Android app) and also the Breakroom folder (this is where we currently have a web app and backend. the backend is being used by the Android app to get data), We stopped in the middle of trying to get the view ticket functionality working on the company portal. we were looking at the web version to try to copy it but it was not functioning correctly. can you restart the process now?

i would like to start a brand new project in a new folder. the folder would be right next to Android and Breakroom and it would be called 'BreakTest'. inside this folder i want a new git repository which will be pushed to the same github.com/Cherry-Blossom-Development organization but a new repo (called BreakTest).  This repo will house testing done with both Appium for Android (and eventually iOS) as well as Selenium testing for the web application.  can you create this framework?
